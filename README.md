# Hello, in this small project we used Jupyter Notebook for a better experience with Python 🐍🐍 ⛥
The Pandas library was also used for data analysis and cleaning. 
With it, you can create interactive charts, maps, scatter plots, and more.
Finally, Plotly.express was used to create amazing visualizations with ease using the Python programming language.

---> I used a .csv file that is not available within this project, you can choose your own file and modify the code as needed

# Down, you'll find png photos of the graphics!
